# STIGs

The purpose of this repository is to provide scripts to automate Security Technical Implementation Guide (STIG) checks. These are industry technical security standards created by the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA). DISA releases standards utilizing DoD definitions and certificates. Not every check is applicable to your device or organization. Every check is scripted though to provide complete coverage; simple ignore the checks you don't need.
